## Pope Francis

**Pope Francis**, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church in March 2013. As the first Latin American pope, the first Jesuit, and the first non-European in more than 1,200 years, his election signaled a shift toward a more global Church.

During his time as pope, Francis was widely regarded for his humility, reformist spirit, and deep concern for issues like poverty, climate change, and social justice. He made headlines with his inclusive tone, welcoming marginalized groups and emphasizing compassion over condemnation.

Notably, his encyclical *Laudato Si’*, released in 2015, was a groundbreaking call to environmental responsibility, urging both believers and non-believers to take care of "our common home." He also worked to address issues within the Church, including clerical abuse and financial reform.

In many ways, Pope Francis’s papacy redefined what it means to lead in the 21st century—marked by a blend of tradition and progress, spirituality and action.

## The Passing of Pope Francis

The world mourned when, in April 2025, the Vatican confirmed the death of Pope Francis at the age of 88. After years of declining health and several hospitalizations, he died peacefully at the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City.

His death triggered a solemn 9-day period of mourning known as **“novemdiales”**, during which Masses were held daily and people from around the world came to pay their respects. His body was displayed in St. Peter’s Basilica, drawing millions of mourners.

This moment also marked the beginning of the **interregnum**, a temporary phase where the Holy See is vacant (*sede vacante*) and the Church prepares for the election of a new pope.

## Who Are the New Pope Candidates?

With Pope Francis’s death, the question on everyone’s lips has become: **Who will be chosen as the next pope?**  

Only cardinals under the age of 80 are eligible to vote—and be elected—in the papal conclave. As of 2025, around 130 such cardinal-electors from across the world will gather in the Sistine Chapel.

While anyone could technically be elected pope (even a layman), tradition and history suggest the next leader will come from among the cardinals. Here are a few of the top contenders:

### 1. **Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle (Philippines)**  
Seen by many as a “Francis 2.0,” Tagle is warm, articulate, and globally minded. His experience as a missionary leader in Asia could give the Church a new global face.

### 2. **Cardinal Pietro Parolin (Italy)**  
A seasoned Vatican insider, Parolin has served as Secretary of State under Francis and is deeply familiar with the Church’s inner workings. He is a favorite among those who prefer institutional continuity.

### 3. **Cardinal Peter Turkson (Ghana)**  
Turkson has long been a symbol of African Catholicism’s growth. With a strong voice for economic justice and interfaith dialogue, he could become the first Black pope in modern history.

### 4. **Cardinal Matteo Zuppi (Italy)**  
Progressive, pastoral, and socially engaged, Zuppi represents a continuation of Francis’s more liberal tone. He is especially beloved in Italy for his grassroots approach to Church leadership.

Each candidate reflects different priorities: theological conservatism, progressive reform, geographical representation, or administrative expertise. The choice will depend on what direction the cardinal-electors believe the Church should take in this critical time.

## When Will They Pick a New Pope?

The election of a new pope doesn’t happen immediately after a pope dies. The **papal conclave**, a centuries-old process, typically begins 15 to 20 days after the pope’s death. This delay allows time for mourning and preparations.

In 2025, the conclave is expected to begin in **early May**, with all eligible cardinals summoned to Vatican City. The conclave takes place within the **Sistine Chapel**, where the cardinals are completely isolated from the outside world to ensure a prayerful and undistracted selection.

Balloting happens twice each morning and afternoon. A two-thirds majority is required to elect a new pope. After each round of voting, the ballots are burned in a stove. This leads to the famous question: *What color is the smoke today?*

## Who Is the New Pope 2025?

As of now, the world still waits for the answer to the pressing question: **Who is the new pope in 2025?**  

The process is confidential, and only when a candidate has secured the required majority and accepted the role will the white smoke rise from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel.

Once a new pope is elected, he chooses a papal name and is introduced to the public from the balcony of **St. Peter’s Basilica** with the traditional phrase: *“Habemus Papam”*—“We have a pope!”

Given the secrecy of the conclave and the spiritual nature of the vote, surprises are always possible. The next pope may very well be a familiar name—or someone the world has barely heard of.

## Who Is the Current Pope?

At this moment, **there is no sitting pope**. The position is officially vacant until the new pontiff is elected and accepts the role. During this time, the Vatican is run by the **Camerlengo**, who oversees daily operations and ensures the integrity of the conclave.

Once elected, the new pope will immediately become the **spiritual leader of the Catholic Church**, the **Bishop of Rome**, and the **Vicar of Christ**. He will not only inherit the Church's traditions but also take on pressing global challenges—from climate change to political unrest to internal Church reform.

Until then, the Church and the world remain in a state of anticipation.

## What Colour Smoke When Pope Elected? | Pope Smoke Signals Explained

One of the most iconic and mysterious elements of the papal election is the **smoke signals** from the Sistine Chapel.

- **Black smoke (fumata nera):** This means no pope has been elected.
- **White smoke (fumata bianca):** This signals that a new pope has been chosen!

The smoke is produced by burning the ballots from the conclave, along with specific chemical additives to achieve the distinct colors. In recent conclaves, technology has been used to make the colors more visible and avoid confusion.

### Fun fact:  
To ensure there’s no misunderstanding, **bells of St. Peter’s Basilica** also ring alongside the white smoke to confirm that the world has a new pope.

This tradition dates back centuries and continues to be a powerful, simple way of communicating with millions watching around the world. Today, the entire event is livestreamed and closely followed across social media platforms.

## Conclusion

As the Church and its followers around the world come to terms with the death of Pope Francis, attention now turns to the future. **Who is the new pope?** It’s a question that captures the hopes, fears, and dreams of a global faith community.

From the cardinals gathering in secret to the rising of white smoke, the world watches and waits for the next spiritual leader of the Catholic Church to step onto the balcony and greet the people.

Whoever is chosen will carry the legacy of past popes while facing new and evolving challenges. And when that moment comes, when the white smoke rises and the bells ring—billions will be watching.
